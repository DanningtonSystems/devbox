# Devbox

A toolbox for developers, containing resources for learning new languages, setting up development environments and toolchains, and other useful tools and resources both related *and* unrelated to software/web/general development.

Each category is organised into a file of its' own. For example, design is put into `DESIGN.md` and system administration is put into `SYSADMIN.md`.
